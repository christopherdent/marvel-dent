WIP

-Login/Signup
--Will use sessions, backend already setup


-Redux conversion
--Broke live search, temp. disabled
--main search returns error if one character or space as search term
---solutions: 
----Form validation?  only let form be submitted if at least a 2 char search
----conditional?  if the response is NOT an array of comics, don't try to render one
